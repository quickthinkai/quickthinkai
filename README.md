## 3️⃣ **Pin your repositories**

Pinned repos show at the top of your profile, like Ajay Yadav’s.

1. Go to your **profile** → click **“Customize your pins”**.
2. Select the repos you want to highlight (e.g., Laravel + FlutterFlow project).
3. Click **“Save”**.

✅ Now visitors immediately see your key projects.

## 4️⃣ **Optional: Add profile README**

You can make a **profile-level README** that appears on your profile page (like a mini homepage).

Steps:

1. Create a **new repo** with the **exact name as your GitHub username**.  
   Example: if your username is `shahji`, repo name must be `shahji`.
2. Add a `README.md` in that repo.
3. Commit it → GitHub automatically shows it on your profile homepage.

You can include:
- Bio
- Skills
- Project highlights
- Links to pinned repos

---

## ✅ Result

After doing these:
- Profile looks professional.
- Pinned repos highlight your best work.
- Each repo has a clear README explaining the project.
- Visitors see a **Follow button** automatically.

If you want, I can **write a ready-to-use profile README for you**, so your GitHub profile will immediately look like a polished portfolio.  

Do you want me to do that?
